# Happy thoughts Project

In this week's project, we were able to using React state skills fetch and post data to an API. The user can 
add new thoughts and see the current posted thoughts from other users.

list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)
Thoughts show the content of the message and how many likes they've received
Have a form to post new thoughts
Implemented the heart button to send likes on a thought
Adapting to the different viewports
Show a count below the form input that updates as the user types and shows how many characters are remaining. Make it go red when the user has typed over 140 characters
When POSTing a new thought, if the message was empty, too long, or too short, you get an error message back from the API. 
Keep count of how many different posts user has liked (different from how many times a post has been liked).
Add an animation for when a new thought is submitted and appears in the list below
Handle loading states.
